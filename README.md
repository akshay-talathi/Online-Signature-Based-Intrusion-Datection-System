# Online-Signature-Based-Intrusion-Datection-System

1. Spearheaded team of 3 to implement Signature-Based Database Intrusion Detection System Using Counting Bloom Filter (CBF).
2. Signature based IDS maintains a database of known attack signatures and examines the on-going traffic and activity of users for comparison with known patterns of events.
3. It issues an alert when any signs of malicious attack are noted.
4. We focused more on the future improvements our project could bring in the field of database management.
5. Studied Counting Bloom Filter Algorithm and made program to work it for intrusion detections.

## Technologies used in the project-
1. Used JSP-Servlet for developing application in Eclipse framework.
2. Apache Tomcat was used as a Server.
3. HTML-CSS for front-end.
4. MySQL database was used for maintaining database.
5. Focused on security aspects to prevent SQL injection, brute-force attacks and Denial of Service attacks.
